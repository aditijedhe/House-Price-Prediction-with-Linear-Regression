## House-Price-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression
I did this exercise long back, It is quiet simple yet full of various techniques. 
I have used Linear Regression to solve the problem. In this excersie you will find a lot of Data Cleaning as the dataset was quiet messy.
Hope you learn from the excerise.
Keep Learning!!!!
